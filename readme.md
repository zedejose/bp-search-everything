This plugin allows searching across a BuddyPress' site components, and WordPress content

## Description ##

Creates a new component, called Search Everything (for which you need to define a root page, under
Settings > BuddyyPress > Pages). Search is separate from both WordPress' and BuddyPress' (per component)
search, which remain active and functional.

It is initiated from a new widget, called Search Everything, which
implements the necessary form.

Keep in mind that the plugin does nothing if BuddyPress isn't installed or activated
